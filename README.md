# The 27 times table

To ensure that you have understood all the exercise thus far see if you can use what you have learned to write a program to calculate the first 16 numbers in the 27 times table.  The smallest of these numbers is 0 and the largest is 405.  These 16 numbers should be stored in an array called `timesTable`.  Please use a for loop in your program and use `i` as the loop variable.
